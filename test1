Legion | gatling based framework demo

Simple showcase of a maven project using the gatling-maven-plugin.

To test it out, simply execute the following command:

$mvn gatling:test -Dgatling.simulationClass=computerdatabase.SimulationName
or simply:

$mvn gatling:test
Place all your payload requests for different requests in different txt files under Resources/data folder

Place all your data files (csv format) also under resources/data folder

Variables Usage:

- In Jenkins, we can parametrize the job and add as many parameters as required. For example, ivr_users is the paramater name in Jenkins which is being passed as
    ivrUsers to our Gatling test
    clean gatling:test -DivrUsers=$ivr_users -DdbpUsers=$dbp_users -DuhcUsers=$myUHC_users
- Now in our pom.xml, we will be referring to these variables via user defined variables as shown below:
    <jvmArgs>
              <jvmArg>-Divrusers=${ivrUsers}</jvmArg>
              <jvmArg>-Ddbpusers=${dbpUsers}</jvmArg>
              <jvmArg>-Duhcusers=${uhcUsers}</jvmArg>
    </jvmArgs>
- We will then reference to these variables in our scala scripts as shown below:
     val ivrUsrCnt: Int = System.getProperty("ivrusers").toInt
Data from csv need to be used via feeder in the respective scenario and will be used within payload (txt file) as ${var name}
